# New Features and Fixes - January 2025

This document outlines the new features and bug fixes implemented in January 2025.

## üîê Authentication Improvements

### Environment-Based User Management

**Issue**: Valid authentication users were hardcoded in the `SimpleAuth` middleware, making user management inflexible and requiring code changes.

**Solution**: Moved user authentication to environment configuration.

**Configuration**:
```bash
# .env file
AUTH_USERS="username1:password1,username2:password2,admin:securepassword"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="fallback_password"  # Used if AUTH_USERS is empty
```

**Features**:
- Multiple users supported with comma-separated format
- Whitespace trimming for robust parsing
- Graceful handling of malformed entries
- Fallback to default admin user if no users configured
- No code changes required for user management

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Middleware/SimpleAuth.php` - Added `getValidUsers()` method
- `tests/Unit/Middleware/SimpleAuthEnvTest.php` - Comprehensive test coverage

## ‚èπÔ∏è Analysis Stop Functionality

### Stop Running Analyses

**Issue**: No way to stop or cancel analysis jobs once they were started, leading to resource waste and inability to manage long-running processes.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive analysis stop functionality.

**Features**:
- Stop button for processing/pending analyses in the UI
- Confirmation modal with analysis details
- Proper status management with new "cancelled" status
- Queue job cancellation for pending operations
- Logging of stop operations

**Usage**:
1. Navigate to analysis details page
2. Click "Sustabdyti analizƒô" button for processing analyses
3. Confirm in modal dialog
4. Analysis is marked as cancelled and pending jobs are stopped

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/AnalysisController.php` - Added `stop()` method
- `app/Models/AnalysisJob.php` - Added `STATUS_CANCELLED` and `isCancelled()` method
- `resources/views/analyses/show.blade.php` - Added stop button and modal
- `routes/web.php` - Added stop route
- `tests/Feature/AnalysisStopTest.php` - Comprehensive test coverage

**API Endpoint**:
```http
POST /analysis/stop
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

job_id=your-job-id-here
```

## üîÑ Repeat Analysis Fixes

### Fixed Repeat Analysis Job System

**Issue**: Repeat analysis functionality was broken due to:
- Missing `dispatchAnalysisJobs()` method causing fatal errors
- Using outdated `AnalyzeTextJob` instead of current `BatchAnalysisJobV4` architecture
- Incorrect model extraction and job creation logic

**Solution**: Complete rewrite of repeat analysis system to use current architecture.

**Improvements**:
- Uses modern `BatchAnalysisJobV4` job system for consistency
- Properly extracts requested models from original analysis
- Handles both new (with `requested_models`) and legacy analysis formats
- Better error handling and validation
- Maintains compatibility with existing analysis structure

**Features**:
- Repeat with original prompt, standard prompt, or custom prompt
- Preserves all original text content and expert annotations
- Uses same models as original analysis
- Proper job progress tracking
- Comprehensive validation

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/AnalysisController.php` - Fixed repeat logic and added `dispatchAnalysisJobs()`
- `tests/Feature/AnalysisRepeatTest.php` - Full test coverage

## üìä Mission Control IDLE Status Fix

### Fixed Concurrent Model Status Display

**Issue**: When multiple Claude models were requested simultaneously, the second model would show "IDLE" status in Mission Control even while actively processing, because it didn't have a `ModelResult` record yet.

**Solution**: Enhanced mission control logic to check for requested models without results.

**Improvements**:
- Checks `requested_models` field in `AnalysisJob` for pending processing
- Properly tracks models that are requested but haven't completed yet
- Shows "processing" status for active models without results
- Maintains accuracy for completed and failed models

**Logic Enhancement**:
```php
// Now checks if model was requested but has no results yet
if ($analysis->analysisJob && 
    in_array($analysis->analysisJob->status, ['pending', 'processing']) &&
    $analysis->analysisJob->requested_models &&
    in_array($modelKey, $analysis->analysisJob->requested_models)) {
    $modelWasUsed = true;
    // Will be counted as pending
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/WebController.php` - Enhanced mission control logic
- `tests/Feature/MissionControlConcurrentModelsTest.php` - Comprehensive test coverage

## üöÄ Speed Metrics Implementation

### Dashboard Speed Column Population

**Issue**: The "Greitis" (speed) column in the dashboard was always empty because execution time wasn't being measured in the `ModelAnalysisJob` class.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive execution time measurement throughout the analysis pipeline.

**Improvements**:
- Added execution time measurement around all API calls in `ModelAnalysisJob`
- Updated `TextAnalysis::getModelExecutionTime()` to check new `ModelResult` table
- Enhanced `ModelAnalysisJob` to pass execution time to `storeModelResult()`
- Proper time tracking for both successful and failed analyses

**Implementation**:
```php
// Measure execution time for the entire model processing
$startTime = microtime(true);
// ... API processing ...
$endTime = microtime(true);
$executionTimeMs = (int) round(($endTime - $startTime) * 1000);
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Jobs/ModelAnalysisJob.php` - Added execution time measurement
- `app/Models/TextAnalysis.php` - Enhanced `getModelExecutionTime()` method
